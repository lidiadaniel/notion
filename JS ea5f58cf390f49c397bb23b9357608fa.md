## #Conditionals

Conditional statements are used for make decisions based on different conditions. By default , statements in JavaScript script executed sequentially from top to bottom. If the processing logic require so, the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two ways:

- Conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression is true
- Repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as long as a certain expression is true. In this section, we will cover *if*, *else* , *else if* statements. The comparison and logical operators we learned in the previous sections will be useful in here.

Conditions can be implementing using the following ways:

- if
- if else
- if else if else
- switch
- ternary operator

### If

In JavaScript and other programming languages the key word *if* is to used check if a condition is true and to execute the block code. To create an if condition, we need *if* keyword, condition inside a parenthesis and block of code inside a curly bracket({})

```html
// syntax
if (condition) {
  //this part of code runs for truthy condition
}
```

example:

```html
let num = 3
if (num > 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is a positive number`)
}
//  3 is a positive number
```

As you can see in the condition example above, 3 is greater than 0, so it is a positive number. The condition was true and the block of code was executed. However, if the condition is false, we won't see any results.

```html
let isRaining = true
if (isRaining) {
  console.log('Remember to take your rain coat.')
}
```

The same goes for the second condition, if isRaining is false the if block will not be executed and we do not see any output. In order to see the result of a falsy condition, we should have another block, which is going to be *else*.

### If Else

If condition is true the first block will be executed, if not the else condition will be executed.

```html
// syntax
if (condition) {
  // this part of code runs for truthy condition
} else {
  // this part of code runs for false condition
}

let num = 3
if (num > 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is a positive number`)
} else {
  console.log(`${num} is a negative number`)
}
//  3 is a positive number

num = -3
if (num > 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is a positive number`)
} else {
  console.log(`${num} is a negative number`)
}
//  -3 is a negative number

let isRaining = true
if (isRaining) {
  console.log('You need a rain coat.')
} else {
  console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
}
// You need a rain coat.

isRaining = false
if (isRaining) {
  console.log('You need a rain coat.')
} else {
  console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
}
// No need for a rain coat.
```

The last condition is false, therefore the else block was executed. What if we have more than two conditions? In that case, we would use *else if* conditions.

### If Else if Else

On our daily life, we make decisions on daily basis. We make decisions not by checking one or two conditions instead we make decisions based on multiple conditions. As similar to our daily life, programming is also full of conditions. We use *else if* when we have multiple conditions.

```html
// syntax
if (condition) {
     // code
} else if (condition) {
   // code
} else {
    //  code

}
```

Example:

```html
let a = 0
if (a > 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is a positive number`)
} else if (a < 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is a negative number`)
} else if (a == 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is zero`)
} else {
  console.log(`${a} is not a number`)
}

// if else if else
let weather = 'sunny'
if (weather === 'rainy') {
  console.log('You need a rain coat.')
} else if (weather === 'cloudy') {
  console.log('It might be cold, you need a jacket.')
} else if (weather === 'sunny') {
  console.log('Go out freely.')
} else {
  console.log('No need for rain coat.')
}
```

### Switch

Switch is an alternative for **if else if else else**. The switch statement starts with a *switch* keyword followed by a parenthesis and code block. Inside the code block we will have different cases. Case block runs if the value in the switch statement parenthesis matches with the case value. The break statement is to terminate execution so the code execution does not go down after the condition is satisfied. The default block runs if all the cases don't satisfy the condition.

```html
switch(caseValue){
  case 1:
    // code
    break
  case 2:
   // code
   break
  case 3:
   // code
   break
  default:
   // code
}

let weather = 'cloudy'
switch (weather) {
  case 'rainy':
    console.log('You need a rain coat.')
    break
  case 'cloudy':
    console.log('It might be cold, you need a jacket.')
    break
  case 'sunny':
    console.log('Go out freely.')
    break
  default:
    console.log(' No need for rain coat.')
}

// Switch More Examples
let dayUserInput = prompt('What day is today ?')
let day = dayUserInput.toLowerCase()

switch (day) {
  case 'monday':
    console.log('Today is Monday')
    break
  case 'tuesday':
    console.log('Today is Tuesday')
    break
  case 'wednesday':
    console.log('Today is Wednesday')
    break
  case 'thursday':
    console.log('Today is Thursday')
    break
  case 'friday':
    console.log('Today is Friday')
    break
  case 'saturday':
    console.log('Today is Saturday')
    break
  case 'sunday':
    console.log('Today is Sunday')
    break
  default:
    console.log('It is not a week day.')
}
```

### Ternary Operators

Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators. We have covered this in other sections, but we should also mention it here.

```html
let isRaining = true
isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
```

## #Arrays

In contrast to variables, an array can store *multiple values*. Each value in an array has an *index*, and each index has *a reference in a memory address*. Each value can be accessed by using their *indexes*. The index of an array starts from *zero*, and the index of the last element is less by one from the length of the array.

An array is a collection of different data types which are ordered and changeable(modifiable). An array allows storing duplicate elements and different data types. An array can be empty, or it may have different data type values.

## #Loops

Most of the activities we do in life are full of repetitions. Imagine if I ask you to print out from 0 to 100 using console.log(). To implement this simple task it may take you 2 to 5 minutes, such kind of tedious and repetitive task can be carried out using loop.

FOR LOOP

```html
// For loop structure
for(initialization, condition, increment/decrement){
  // code goes here
}
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2 3 4 5

for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  console.log(`${i} * ${i} = ${i * i}`)
}
output
0 * 0 = 0
1 * 1 = 1
2 * 2 = 4
3 * 3 = 9
4 * 4 = 16
5 * 5 = 25

//Adding all elements in the array
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let sum = 0
for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
  sum  = sum + numbers[i]  // can be shorten, sum += numbers[i]

}

console.log(sum)  // 15
```

WHILE LOOP

```html
let i = 0
while (i <= 5) {
  console.log(i)
  i++
}

// 0 1 2 3 4 5
```

DO WHILE LOOP

```html
let i = 0
do {
  console.log(i)
  i++
} while (i <= 5)

// 0 1 2 3 4 5
```

### for of loop

We use for of loop for arrays. It is very hand way to iterate through an array if we are not interested in the index of each element in the array.

```html
for (const element of arr) {
  // code goes here
}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for (const num of numbers) {
  console.log(num)
}

// 1 2 3 4 5
```

```html
break
Break is used to interrupt a loop.

for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  if(i == 3){
    break
  }
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2
```

```html
continue
We use the keyword continue to skip a certain iterations.

for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  if(i == 3){
    continue
  }
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2 4 5
```
